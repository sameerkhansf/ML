## Introduction

The Blood-Brain Barrier Permeability Prediction Project is a computational chemistry research initiative focused on understanding and predicting molecular permeability across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This project aims to develop machine learning models that can predict BBB permeability from molecular structure, providing insights into the key molecular descriptors and structural features that influence brain drug delivery.

The blood-brain barrier represents one of the most significant challenges in central nervous system drug development. The tight gap allows only passive diffusion of lipid-soluble drugs at a molecular weight lower than 400-600 Da, with increasing lipophilicity being a feasible method to improve BBB permeability. This project will analyze the BBBP dataset to build predictive models and extract meaningful structure-activity relationships for BBB permeability.
